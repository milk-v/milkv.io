# EsSimulator Simulation Tool

## Introduction to EsSimulator Tool

EsSimulator is an offline testing tool used to compare whether the generated model's computation results are consistent with the original model. EsSimulator takes offline models generated by EsACC and validates the model's correctness using the input and expected output tensor data generated by EsGoldenDataGen.

EsSimulator is an offline verification tool that quickly checks the correctness of models, making it convenient for debugging, locating model issues, and evaluating model performance.
