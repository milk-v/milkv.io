# WIFI Module

Megrez has an E Key (SDIO/UART) and supports WIFI modules (SDIO/UART).

The following are verified WIFI module models:

- AP6575S

## AP6275S

The AMPAK Technology® AP6275S is a fully Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionalities module with seamless roaming capabilities and advance security, also it could interact with different vendors’ 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax 2x2 Access Points with MIMO standard and can accomplish up to speed of 1200Mbps with dual stream in 802.1ax to connect the wireless LAN. Furthermore AP6275S included SDIO interface for Wi-Fi, UART/PCM interface for Bluetooth.

In addition, this compact module is a total solution for a combination of Wi-Fi + BT technologies. The module is specifically developed for tablet, OTT box and portable devices.
