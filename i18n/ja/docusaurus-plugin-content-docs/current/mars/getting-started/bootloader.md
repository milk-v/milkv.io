# Milk-V Mars Bootloader Update Guide

Whether Mars starts the system through the SD card or the eMMC module, it must be started through the Bootloader boot program. This boot program is stored in an SPI Flash on the board and contains two parts: `SPL` and `U-Boot`.

:::tip
The Bootloader in Mars can be understood as the BIOS in PC
:::

When Mars is shipped, it already comes with a pre-installed initial Bootloader program. There is no need to upgrade this program during normal usage. Bootloader upgrade is only necessary in the following situations:

1. When the bootloader program in SPI Flash is accidentally damaged, causing the system to fail to start normally.
2. When upgrading the official system image (such as Debian), it must be matched with the new bootloader, otherwise it cannot be started.
3. U-Boot has fixed some bugs or added new functions. When you need to use these new functions.

There are several ways to update the Bootloader in SPI Flash on Mars, such as Windows burning tools, TFTP, flashcp commands, etc. Here are the methods of using the `flashcp` command and using the `UsbFlashTool` burning tool in Windows systems.

## Update Bootloader using flashcp command

If the current bootloader of your Mars can boot the Debian system normally, you can use the `flashcp` command in the Debian system to update the bootloader.

1. Install flashcp command

   The `flashcp` command in the Debian system is included in the `mtd-utils` package. Execute the following command to install:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mtd-utils
   ```

2. Download Bootloader Firmware

   [Bootloader firmware](https://github.com/milkv-mars/mars-buildroot-sdk/releases)

   The firmware contains two files, `SPL` and `U-Boot`:
   ```
   SPL:    mars_u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out
   U-Boot: mars_visionfive2_fw_payload.img
   ```
   You can download it directly on Mars, or download it on PC and then transfer it to Mars through scp command or USB flash drive.

3. View SPI Flash partition information
   ```
   cat /proc/mtd
   ```
   The output is as follows:
   ```
   user@milkv:~$ cat /proc/mtd
   dev:    size   erasesize  name
   mtd0: 00040000 00001000 "spl"
   mtd1: 00300000 00001000 "uboot"
   mtd2: 00100000 00001000 "data"
   ```
   We need to update `SPL` to the `mtd0` partition and `U-Boot` to the `mtd1` partition.

4. Update Bootloader

   Update SPL:
   ```bash
   sudo flashcp -v mars_u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out /dev/mtd0
   ```
   Update U-Boot:
   ```bash
   sudo flashcp -v mars_visionfive2_fw_payload.img /dev/mtd1
   ```
   The output of successful execution is as follows:
   ```
   user@milkv:~$ sudo flashcp -v mars_u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out /dev/mtd0
   Erasing blocks: 36/36 (100%)
   Writing data: 143k/143k (100%)
   Verifying data: 143k/143k (100%)
   user@milkv:~$
   user@milkv:~$ sudo flashcp -v mars_visionfive2_fw_payload.img /dev/mtd1
   Erasing blocks: 723/723 (100%)
   Writing data: 2890k/2890k (100%)
   Verifying data: 2890k/2890k (100%)
   ```

After powering on again, you can determine whether the bootloader has been updated based on the timestamp in the UART serial port log:

```
U-Boot SPL 2021.10 (Nov 24 2023 - 10:21:39 +0800)
```
```
U-Boot 2021.10 (Nov 24 2023 - 10:21:39 +0800)
```

## Use UsbFlashTool to upgrade bootloader under Windows

### Download UsbFlashTool burning tool and Bootloader firmware

### Install driver for the burning tool

:::tip
Driver installation is only required for the first use.
:::

Extract the downloaded `Mars-UsbFlashTool-*-Windows.zip` into the Windows system.

1. Connect the USB to TTL serial port cable to the 40 pin header on Mars, connect the USB to the PC and note down the serial port number

   How to connect USB to serial cable: [Use Serial Console](https://milkv.io/docs/mars/getting-satrted/setup#use-serial-console)

   ![mars](/docs/mars/mars-usb-flash-tool_02.png)

   **Note: If any other serial port program is open and using the serial port, please exit the program to release the port and avoid occupying it.**

2. Connect the PC and Mars using a USB 2.0 interface with a type A Male to Male USB data cable

### SD Card Partition

The following takes /dev/sdc as an example:

Run the command `sudo fdisk /dev/sdc` to start fdisk.
```
milkv@milkv-desktop:~$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdc

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.37.2).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help):
```
Enter `n` as prompted to create a new partition.
```
Command (m for help): n
Partition number (1-128, default 1):

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux filesystem' and of size 58.2 GiB.
```
Enter as prompted, or press enter directly.

Note: If Do you want to remove the signature? [Y]es/[N]o appears, select N.

After creation, enter `w` to save and exit.

Enter the command `sudo mkfs.vfat -I /dev/sdc1` to format the partition as FAT32.

Run the command `lsdlk -f ` to check whether the formatting is successful.

```
milkv@milkv-desktop:~$ sudo mkfs.vfat -I /dev/sdc1

```
Run the command `sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt` to mount it to the /mnt directory. You can decide which directory to mount to based on the actual situation.

Copy the downloaded `mars_u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out` and `mars_visionfive2_fw_payload.img` to the mnt directory.

### Refresh u-boot
Assuming your new U-Boot version is on the 1st partition of the SD card, you can install it to the SPI flash using the following commands
```
sf probe
load mmc 0:1 $kernel_addr_r mars_u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out
sf update $kernel_addr_r 0 $filesize
load mmc 0:1 $kernel_addr_r mars_visionfive2_fw_payload.img
sf update $kernel_addr_r 0x100000 $filesize
```
Note: load mmc may be 0:1 or 1:1.

You can run the commands `ls mmc 0:1` and `ls mmc 1:1` to see if the files exist.

```
StarFive # ls mmc 1:1
147336 mars_u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out
2959557 mars_visionfive2_fw_payload.img

2 file(s), 0 dir(s)
```

After updating U-Boot, you may need to reboot and reset the environment to defaults.
```
env default -f -a
env save
```

## Use Uart to start U-BOOT under Linux

When U-BOOT in SPI is damaged and SD card cannot be started, you can use uart to start.
