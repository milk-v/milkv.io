Introduction
------------

The Mars Compute Module (Mars CM) is a state-of-the-art System on Module (SoM) that leverages the capabilities of the StarFive JH7110 System on Chip (SoC). Designed to be a comprehensive yet compact solution, the Mars CM incorporates a Central Processing Unit (CPU), Power Management Unit (PMU), DRAM memory, flash storage, and wireless connectivity options including WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.2. All of these features are packed into a remarkably small form factor, measuring just 55mm x 40mm.

### Design Philosophy

Inspired by the Milk-V Mars architecture, the Mars CM is engineered for both versatility and cost-efficiency. For applications that are particularly cost-sensitive, we offer the Mars CM Lite, which comes without the eMMC storage component.

### Electrical Interface and Physical Form Factor

The Mars CM interfaces with external components via two 100-pin high-density connectors. Its new design yields an even smaller footprint when considering the space occupied by the connectors.

### Configuration Options

The Mars CM is available in a variety of LPDDR4 RAM and eMMC storage configurations. For details on specific models, please refer to the 'Order Info' section.

### Accelerate Your Product Development

The Mars CM is not just a component; it's a catalyst for innovation. By offering a powerful SoM in an ultra-compact form factor, we enable customers to expedite the prototyping phase and move swiftly to production, simply by developing a compatible carrier board.
