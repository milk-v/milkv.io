After the hardware is prepared, you need to burn the system to the Meles storage medium. Depending on the storage medium, you need to choose different installing methods.

### Booting from eMMC

If you use eMMC as the storage medium, you need to refer to the [Install an image to eMMC](../installation/install-an-image-to-emmc.md) section to burn the image to eMMC.

In addition, you may need to flash the firmware in SPI Nor Flash, which is already flashed by default. If you need, you can refer to the [Install an image to SPI Nor Flash](../installation/install-an-image-to-spi-nor-flash.md) section to flash it.

### Booting from MicroSD

If you use a MicroSD card as the storage medium, you need to refer to the [Install an image to MicroSD Card](../installation/install-an-image-to-microsd-card.md) section to burn the image.

In addition, you may need to flash the firmware in SPI Nor Flash, which is already flashed by default. If you need, you can refer to the [Install an image to SPI Nor Flash](../installation/install-an-image-to-spi-nor-flash.md) section to flash it.
