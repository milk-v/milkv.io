## Software testing

This test is only used to verify if the camera is functioning properly. It runs a test program on Duo to stream video, and then using VLC media player on a PC to receive the video stream.

First, make sure you can SSH into the Duo device using USB networking (USB-NCM). The default firmware SSH username and password are root/milkv.

The latest firmware has integrated test program, please use [V1.1.0](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk/releases/tag/Duo-V1.1.0) or [Latest Firmware](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk/releases).

The Test program added face detection demo while pushing the stream.

Log in to the Duo terminal:
```bash
ssh root@192.168.42.1
```

Execute the test program to start streaming:
```bash
camera-test.sh
```

In normal circumstances, the terminal will display the following log at the end:

```

Note the link starting with 'rtsp:', replace the IP with the IP address of Duo, and that will be the streaming address to use in VLC media player.

On your PC, open VLC media player. Go to the 'Media' menu and select 'Open Network Stream' In the 'Network' tab, enter the following URL in the 'Please enter a network URL' field.

```
rtsp://192.168.42.1/h264
```

Click the `Show more options` in the lower left corner, and you can set the `Caching` option to adjust the delay. The default is 1000 milliseconds, which is 1 second. When the network environment is good, such as in a LAN, you can turn it down to reduce latency. You can set it to 100 to 300. If the network environment is poor or the screen freezes, you can try to increase it.

Click 'Play' and you will be able to see the streaming video from the camera.
