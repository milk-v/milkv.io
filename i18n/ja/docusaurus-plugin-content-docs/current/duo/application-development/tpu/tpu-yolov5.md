# Object Detection Based on YOLOv5

## 1. Prepare original model files under windows

### Prepare the YOLOv5 development kit and yolov5n.pt file

Download the [YOLOv5 development toolkit](https://codeload.github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/zip/refs/heads/master) and the [yolov5n.pt](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v6.2/yolov5n.pt) file. Once the download is complete, extract the toolkit and place the `yolov5n.pt` file in the `yolov5-master` directory.

### Configure the conda environment

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) needs to be installed in advance.

Open a new `Anaconda Prompt` terminal and execute `conda env list` to view the current environment.
```
(base) C:\Users\Carbon> conda env list
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  C:\Users\Carbon\anaconda3
```

Create a new conda virtual environment and install version 3.9.0 of python. `duotpu` is the name you chose.
```
(base) C:\Users\Carbon> conda create --name duotpu python=3.9.0
```

Check the current environment again after success.
```
(base) C:\Users\Carbon> conda env list
# conda environments:
#
base                  *  C:\Users\Carbon\anaconda3
duotpu                   C:\Users\Carbon\anaconda3\envs\duotpu
```

Activate the newly installed 3.9.0 environment.
```
(base) C:\Users\Carbon> conda activate duotpu
```

Confirm that the activation is successful.
```
(duotpu) C:\Users\Carbon> conda env list
# conda environments:
#
base                     C:\Users\Carbon\anaconda3
duotpu                *  C:\Users\Carbon\anaconda3\envs\duotpu
```

Then, you can use the following command to install PyTorch version 1.12.1. Please choose the specific installation command based on your requirements. The subsequent process only requires the use of CPU.
```
# CUDA 10.2
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

# CUDA 11.3
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

# CUDA 11.6
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch

# CPU Only
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cpuonly -c pytorch
```

Then `cd` the terminal path to the `yolov5-master` path of the development kit and enter `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install other dependencies.
```
(duotpu) C:\Users\Carbon> cd Duo-TPU\yolov5-master

(duotpu) C:\Users\Carbon\Duo-TPU\yolov5-master> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate original model file

Create a new `main.py` file in the `yolov5-master` directory and write the following code in the file:
```
import torch
from models.experimental import attempt_download
model = torch.load(attempt_download("./yolov5n.pt"),
map_location=torch.device('cpu'))['model'].float()
model.eval()
model.model[-1].export = True
torch.jit.trace(model, torch.rand(1, 3, 640, 640), strict=False).save('./yolov5n_jit.pt')
```

Then find the `yolov5-master/models/yolo.py` file, comment the code from lines 99 to 115, and add the code `return x` on line 116, as shown below:

![duo](/docs/duo/tpu/duo-tpu-yolo5_01.png)

In addition, this file also needs to be modified:
```
C:\Users\Carbon\anaconda3\envs\duotpu\Lib\site-packages\torch\nn\modules\upsampling.py
```
When using conda on linux the file is located at:
```
~/anaconda3/envs/duotpu/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/upsampling.py
```
Make the following changes around line 153

![duo](/docs/duo/tpu/duo-tpu-yolo5_02.png)

After the modification is completed, run the `python main.py` file and the `yolov5n_jit.pt` file will be generated in the `yolov5-master` directory. This file is the required original model file.
```
(duotpu) C:\Users\Carbon\Duo-TPU\yolov5-master> python main.py
```

### Exit the conda environment (optional)

The model files we need have been generated above. You can use the `conda deactivate` command to exit the conda environment:
```
(duotpu) C:\Users\Carbon\Duo-TPU\yolov5-master> conda deactivate
```

If you no longer need this conda virtual environment (duotpu), you can delete it with the following command:
```
conda env remove --name <envname>
```

## 2. Configure Docker development environment

Refer to [here](https://milkv.io/docs/duo/application-development/tpu/tpu-docker). After configuring the Docker development environment, return here to continue the next step.

:::warning
If you are using a configured Docker development environment, please make sure to follow the Docker configuration tutorial to execute command `source ./tpu-mlir/envsetup.sh` after starting Docker, otherwise errors may occur in subsequent steps.
:::

## 3. Prepare the working directory in Docker

Create and enter the `yolov5n_torch` working directory, note that it is a directory at the same level as `tpu-mlir`, and put the model files and image files into this directory
```
# mkdir yolov5n_torch && cd yolov5n_torch
```

Create a new Windows terminal and copy `yolov5n_jit.pt` from windows to Docker
```
docker cp <path>/yolov5-master/yolov5n_jit.pt <container_name>:/workspace/yolov5n_torch/yolov5n_jit.pt
```

`<path>` is the file directory where the yolov5 development kit is located in the windows system, and `<container_name>` is the container name, such as
```
docker cp C:\Users\Carbon\Duo-TPU\yolov5-master\yolov5n_jit.pt DuoTPU:/workspace/yolov5n_torch/yolov5n_jit.pt
```

Go back to the Docker terminal and put the image file into the current directory (`yolov5n_torch`)
```
# cp -rf ${TPUC_ROOT}/regression/dataset/COCO2017 .
# cp -rf ${TPUC_ROOT}/regression/image .
```
`${TPUC_ROOT}` here is an environment variable, corresponding to the `tpu-mlir` directory, which is loaded in the `source ./tpu-mlir/envsetup.sh` step in the previous configuration of the Docker development environment.

Create and enter the `work` working directory to store compiled files such as `MLIR` and `cvimodel`
```
# mkdir work && cd work
```

## 4. YOLOv5n-TORCH Model conversion

:::tip
The Duo development board is equipped with the CV1800B chip, which supports the **ONNX series** and **Caffe models**. Currently, it does not support TFLite models. In terms of quantized data types, it supports **quantization in BF16 format** and **asymmetric quantization in INT8 format**.
:::

The steps for model conversion are as follows:
- Convert TORCH model to MLIR
- Generate calibration tables required for quantification
- MLIR quantization into INT8 asymmetric cvimodel

### TORCH model converted to MLIR

In this example, the model is RGB input, `mean` and `scale` are `0,0,0` and `0.0039216`, `0.0039216`, `0.0039216` respectively
The command to convert TORCH model to MLIR model is as follows
 ```
# model_transform.py \
 --model_name yolov5n \
 --model_def ../yolov5n_jit.pt \
 --input_shapes [[1,3,640,640]] \
 --pixel_format "rgb" \
 --keep_aspect_ratio \
 --mean 0,0,0 \
 --scale 0.0039216,0.0039216,0.0039216 \
 --test_input ../image/dog.jpg \
 --test_result yolov5n_top_outputs.npz \
 --output_names 1219,1234,1249 \
 --mlir yolov5n.mlir
 ```

Example of successful operation

![duo](/docs/duo/tpu/duo-tpu-yolo5_06.png)

After converting to the MLIR model, a `yolov5n.mlir` file will be generated, which is the MLIR model file. A `yolov5n_in_f32.npz` file and a `yolov5n_top_outputs.npz` file will also be generated, which are the input files for subsequent model conversion.

![duo](/docs/duo/tpu/duo-tpu-yolo5_07.png)

### MLIR to INT8 model

#### Generate calibration tables required for quantification

Before converting to the INT8 model, you need to generate a calibration table. Here we use the existing 100 pictures from COCO2017 as an example to execute calibration.
```
# run_calibration.py yolov5n.mlir \
 --dataset ../COCO2017 \
 --input_num 100 \
 -o ./yolov5n_cali_table
 ```

Example of successful operation

![duo](/docs/duo/tpu/duo-tpu-yolo5_08.png)

After the operation is completed, the `yolov5n_cali_table` file will be generated, which is used for subsequent compilation of the INT8 model.

![duo](/docs/duo/tpu/duo-tpu-yolo5_09.png)

#### MLIR quantized into INT8 asymmetric cvimodel

The command to convert MLIR model to INT8 model is as follows
```
# model_deploy.py \
 --mlir yolov5n.mlir \
 --quantize INT8 \
 --calibration_table ./yolov5n_cali_table \
 --chip cv180x \
 --test_input ../image/dog.jpg \
 --test_reference yolov5n_top_outputs.npz \
 --compare_all \
 --tolerance 0.96,0.72 \
 --fuse_preprocess \
 --debug \
 --model yolov5n_int8_fuse.cvimodel
 ```

:::tip
If the development board you are using is not Duo, please replace the fifth line `-- chip cv180x` in the above command with the corresponding chip model.
When using Duo 256M/Duo S , it should be changed to ` -- chip cv181x`.
:::

Example of successful operation

![duo](/docs/duo/tpu/duo-tpu-yolo5_10.png)

After compilation is completed, the `yolov5n_int8_fuse.cvimodel` file will be generated.
