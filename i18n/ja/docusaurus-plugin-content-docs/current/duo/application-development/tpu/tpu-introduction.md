# Introduction

:::tip
This section is only used to perform some simple tests on TPU. For TPU-related development, it is recommended to use [TDL SDK](https://milkv.io/docs/duo/application-development/tdl-sdk/tdl-sdk-introduction), which integrates most of the functions of TPU and provides some interfaces.

The CPU of the Duo series development board integrates the CVITEK TPU for intelligent detection.

TPU is an AI acceleration engine for deep learning neural networks, which can be used to accelerate image classification, object detection, face detection and recognition, segmentation, LSTM, and more. The main function of TPU is to offload CPU work and accelerate computer vision and voice-related operations.

The model-related parameters supported by TPU are as follows:
