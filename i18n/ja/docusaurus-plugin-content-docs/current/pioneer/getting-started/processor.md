# SOPHON SG2042 

## Introduction of SOPHON SG2042

The SG2042 server chip is based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) and features a 64-core server-grade chip designed to meet high-performance computing needs. It offers scalability, flexibility, and customization, with integrated circuits including high-speed cache (L3Cache 64MB), memory controller (4 DDR4-3200), network interface, and PCI Express® controller (x32 PCI Express Gen4.0), supporting general-purpose operating systems such as Linux®. The SG2042 has a clock speed of 2GHz and a design consisting of 16 clusters, each containing 4 RISC-V cores, with each core featuring L1-D 64KB and L1-I 64KB. Each cluster shares a design of L2 1MB. The L3 System cache has a capacity of 64MB. The SG2042 supports interconnect between two chips via CCIX and has 4 DDR4-3200 controllers, supporting RDIMM, ECC, and UDIMM. The chip also has 32x PCI E Gen4.0 interfaces, integrated eMMC5.1, SDIO 3.0, SPI x2, I2C x4, UART x4, and gigabit Ethernet MAC.
