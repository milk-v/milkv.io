- Connecting Other Power Cords  
    Depending on your computer configuration and needs, it may also be necessary to connect other power cables, such as hard drive power and graphics card power. These cables usually have specific connectors and connect to the appropriate ports on the motherboard and other hardware devices.

- Organizing the power cables  
    After connecting all the necessary power cables, make sure they are organized and placed inside the case to avoid blocking fans or other components and to ensure air circulation.
