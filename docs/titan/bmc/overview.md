# BMC Overview

## Introduction

BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) is a dedicated unit in a server for hardware monitoring and management, featuring remote management, continuous monitoring, and troubleshooting capabilities. As an independent subsystem, the BMC has its own firmware and operates independently of core hardware components on the motherboard, such as the CPU and EC, but it can interact with these components to achieve comprehensive monitoring and management of the server.

Titan BMC is a web-based management platform designed specifically for Milk-V Titan systems. It provides an intuitive interface for managing your Titan host, offering features such as:

- **Remote Console Access**: Connect to the host terminal via UART or TTY without physical access
- **Power Management**: Control host power states (start, shutdown, reboot) remotely
- **System Monitoring**: View real-time status and resource information
- **Agent Deployment**: Easily install and manage host agents for enhanced functionality
- **Web-Based Interface**: Manage your Titan system from any device with a web browser
