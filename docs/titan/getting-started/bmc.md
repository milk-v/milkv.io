# BMC Usage

## BMC Introduction

BMC (Baseboard Management Controller) is a dedicated unit in a server for hardware monitoring and management, featuring remote management, continuous monitoring, and troubleshooting capabilities. As an independent subsystem, the BMC has its own firmware and operates independently of core hardware components on the motherboard, such as the CPU and EC, but it can interact with these components to achieve comprehensive monitoring and management of the server.
