## DDR4 Support List
Please check the [DDR Support List](https://github.com/milkv-pioneer/hardware/blob/main/sg2042_ddr_support_list.md)

Installing memory sticks that are not included in the list may prevent proper boot-up.  

You can contact us to purchase original support DDR.
## Memory Installation
When installing, please install the DDR slots in order from the DDR slot near the side of the PCIe slot.  

Please note that when installing multiple memory sticks, make sure that the memory sticks are installed starting from the DDR4 slot near the PCIe slot and no empty slots are allowed between each two memory sticks.
