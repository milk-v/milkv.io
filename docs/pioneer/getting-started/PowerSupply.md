    Make sure you have a desktop power supply that is suitable for your computer's configuration and power requirements, and that it has a 24-pin motherboard power connector.

- Turn off your computer  
    Before starting the installation, make sure your computer is completely turned off and disconnected from the power supply.

- Open the case  
    Look carefully at your desktop chassis to locate the power supply mounting area. Usually the power supply is located at the top or bottom of the case, and it is a rectangular metal or plastic box.

- Connecting Other Power Cords  
    Depending on your computer configuration and needs, it may also be necessary to connect other power cables, such as hard drive power and graphics card power. These cables usually have specific connectors and connect to the appropriate ports on the motherboard and other hardware devices.

- Organizing the power cables  
    After connecting all the necessary power cables, make sure they are organized and placed inside the case to avoid blocking fans or other components and to ensure air circulation.

- Close the case  
    After ensuring that all power cables are connected to the correct locations, reinstall the side or top panel of the chassis.
